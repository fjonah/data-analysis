#  Social Meda Data Analysis

In this project the goal is to  create a comprehensive report that analyzes the performance of different categories of social media posts.

The goal is to help a social media marketing company that specializes in promoting brands and products on a popular social media platform. The team is responsible for analyzing the performance of different types of posts based on categories, such as health, family, food, etc. to help clients optimize their social media strategy and increase their reach and engagement.  

They want me to use Python to automatically extract tweets posted from one or more categories, and to clean, analyze and visualize the data. The team will use my analysis to  making data-driven recommendations to clients to improve their social media performance. This feature will help the marketing agency deliver tweets on time, within budget, and gain fast results.

Project Objectives:

- Increase client reach and engagement

- Gain valuable insights that will help improve social media performance

- Achieve their social media goals and provide data-driven recommendations


After I performed my analysis, I came to the following conlusions:

# Conclusions
Since this data is randomly generated using random libraries, the results are also more or less the same for all variables observed regarding the mean, standard deviation and other statistical measures.

Using a histogram graphical representation allows us to observe how many posts have the same number of likes. Even though this information can be quickly retrieved by using the mean() method over all Likes, it might be interesting for the company to observe the number of posts with the respective number of likes, to identify possible outliers. This could be a powerful tool to set realizable goals with regards to client reach and engangement.

Further segmentation is required in order to get more specific results and using different categories in order to measure customer engangement in different areas can be an efficient measure, and a very effiecient approach to realize this is using the boxplot to get data about different quantiles.
