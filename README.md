#  Social Meda Data Analysis

In this project the goal is to  create a comprehensive report that analyzes the performance of different categories of social media posts.

The goal is to help a social media marketing company that specializes in promoting brands and products on a popular social media platform. The team is responsible for analyzing the performance of different types of posts based on categories, such as health, family, food, etc. to help clients optimize their social media strategy and increase their reach and engagement.  

They want me to use Python to automatically extract tweets posted from one or more categories, and to clean, analyze and visualize the data. The team will use my analysis to  making data-driven recommendations to clients to improve their social media performance. This feature will help the marketing agency deliver tweets on time, within budget, and gain fast results.

Project Objectives:

- Increase client reach and engagement

- Gain valuable insights that will help improve social media performance

- Achieve their social media goals and provide data-driven recommendations


After I performed my analysis, I will share my findings.
